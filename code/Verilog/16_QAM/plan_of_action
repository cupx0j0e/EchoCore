✔️ Transmitter Side

    Start with random binary data
    ➤ Like 4 bits: 1010, 0101, etc.

    Map it to a 2D point in the 16-QAM grid
    ➤ Example: 1010 → I = +3, Q = +3

    Make it "continuous" using:

        Zero padding (adds gaps to space things out)

        RRC Filter (makes the signal smooth like a real-world wave)

    Send the I and Q data over two "channels":

        I → mix with cosine wave (cos)

        Q → mix with sine wave (sin)

    Add them together
    ➤ Result: A complex-looking waveform carrying your binary data

    Send it to the receiver (through air, fiber, etc.)

✔️ Receiver Side 

    Receive the waveform

    Mix it with cos & sin again to recover I & Q

    Filter it again to clean it up

    Sample and detect the I & Q values

    Map them back to 4-bit binary data
