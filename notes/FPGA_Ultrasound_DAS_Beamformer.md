##  FPGA for Parallel Processing

- **FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)** is highly efficient for **parallel processing** and **massive calculations**.
- In this context, a **ZYNQ device** is used.
- **ZYNQ** integrates a **dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor (PS)** with traditional **FPGA logic fabric (PL)** in a **single chip**.

###  Communication Interface

- The **AXI interface** (Advanced eXtensible Interface) facilitates communication between the PS and PL.
- **AXI** offers:
  - **High bandwidth**
  - **Low latency**
  -  Efficient memory-mapped data transfers

##  What is an ARM Processor?

**ARM (Advanced RISC Machine)** is a processor architecture known for:

- **High efficiency**
-  **Low power consumption**

###  Key Features of ARM:

- **RISC Architecture** (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)  
  → Simpler instructions → Faster execution
- **Power-efficient**  
  → Ideal for mobile and embedded systems

##  What is ZYNQ?

**ZYNQ** is a family of **System-on-Chips (SoCs)** developed by **Xilinx** (now part of **AMD**). It offers a **hybrid architecture**:

### 1. Processing System (PS)

- Dual-core **ARM Cortex-A9**
- Runs **Linux**, **bare-metal C/C++**, or **RTOS**

###  2. Programmable Logic (PL)

- Traditional **FPGA fabric**
- Supports custom hardware acceleration, parallel computing, and real-time signal processing

###  Why Use ZYNQ?

- Combines **software flexibility** (via ARM) with **hardware performance** (via FPGA).
- Ideal for applications needing both **general-purpose processing** and **dedicated hardware acceleration**.
