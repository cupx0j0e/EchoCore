## Keywords
### Shift Register
A shift register is a digital circuit that stores and shifts binary data, commonly used for data storage and serial-to-parallel or parallel-to-serial data conversion. It consists of a chain of flip-flops, where the output of one flip-flop is connected to the input of the next. A clock signal synchronizes the shifting of data from one flip-flop to the next.

### LFSR (Linear feedback shift register)
A Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a shift register where the input bit is a linear function of its previous state, commonly using XOR operations. LFSRs are widely used in cryptography, pseudo-random number generation, and digital signal processing. They are particularly useful because they can generate long sequences of seemingly random bits with a relatively simple hardware implementation.

### LUT (LookUp Table)
A lookup table is a data structure that maps input values to corresponding output values, essentially acting like a "cheat sheet" for quick data retrieval. It's often used to replace complex calculations with a simple table lookup, saving processing time.

### RAM (Random Access Memory)
RAM is a type of computer memory that stores data and instructions that the CPU is actively using. It's called "random access" because the processor can access any memory location directly and quickly. RAM is volatile, meaning the data is lost when the computer is turned off. RAM speed and capacity affect the overall performance of a computer, especially when multitasking or running demanding applications

### ROM (Read Only Memory)
ROM, which stands for Read-Only Memory, is a type of computer memory that stores data permanently. Unlike RAM (Random Access Memory), ROM retains its data even when the power is turned off, making it non-volatile. It's primarily used to store the firmware and instructions needed for a device to boot up and function, such as the BIOS in a computer or the operating system on a mobile phone
