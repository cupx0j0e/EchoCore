# Blog Day 9 & 10 (0.1.2 & 0.1.3)

## Keyword
- Traditional processors vs ASICs vs FPGAs
Although traditional processors (x86 and ARM) are very versatile and can perform practically any type of operation, sometimes its better to have a processor that is really good in performing one type of operation.

ASICs or Application specific integrated circuits are built exactly for that. As their name suggests, ASICs are built to perform a very specific operation, albeit very efficiently. They typically contain hard-wired logic gates which are not reconfigurable.

FPGAs or Field programmable gate arrays fall somewhere between traditional processors and ASICs. Although not as versatile as Traditional processors, they are electrically reconfigurable unlike ASICs which makes them both efficient and customisable making them great for products and prototypes.

- SR flip-flops<br>
An SR Flip-Flop (Set-Reset Flip-Flop) is a basic type of bistable multivibrator that has two inputs—S (Set) and R (Reset)—and two outputs—Q and Q̅ (not-Q). It stores one bit of data and changes its state based on the inputs

    Disadvantages
    - Invalid Condition: When both S and R are 1, the output unpredictable
    - Needs additional logic to work reliably with a clock signal

- D flip-flops<br>
A D flip-flop captures the value on the D (Data) input at the moment of the clock edge and passes it to the output Q. It eliminates the invalid state of SR flip-flops by ensuring only one input

    Disadvantages
    - Cannot toggle output directly
    - Any glitch on the D input gets captured if not managed properly

- JK flip-flops<br>
The JK flip-flop is an improvement over the SR flip-flop. It has two inputs—J and K—and allows toggling when both are high. It avoids the invalid state by toggling instead.

    Disadvantages
    - Race condition can occur if inputs change near clock edges

- Racing Condition in JK flip-flops<br>
    - When J = K = 1, the flip-flop is designed to toggle the output.
    - If the clock pulse is too wide (i.e. not edge-triggered or the high level lasts too long), the output toggles repeatedly before the clock goes LOW.
    - This rapid toggling is called racing, and it causes the final state to be uncertain.

- T flip-flops<br>
A T flip-flop toggles its output on every clock pulse when T = 1, and holds the state when T = 0. It is often derived from a JK flip-flop by tying J = K = T.

    Disadvantages
    - Only toggles or holds; not suitable for all logic operations

## Things I accomplished
- Watched some yt vids about FPGAs to get a general idea of the workflow involved in these projects
- Completed all problems from the Latches and Flip-Flop subcategory on HDLbits
- Completed all problems from the Counters subcategory on HDLbits (Day 10)
