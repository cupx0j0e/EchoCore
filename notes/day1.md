# Blog: Day 1 (0.0.1)

## Keywords
### FPGA:
A **FPGA** or *field-programmable gate array* is a type of IC (integrated circuit) that can be repeatedly programmed after manufacturing. As the name suggests, they consist of an array of programmable logic blocks with a connecting grid that can be configured in a certain way to perform various digital functions.

These configurations are written in HDLs like verilog.

### B-mode ultrasonic imaging
**B-mode ultrasonography** or *brightness mode ultrasonography* is a common imaging technique which involves the use of ultrasonic waves to display a 2-D grayscale image of internal organs.

It works by the visualizing the strength of returning ultrasonic echoes (from internal organs) and mapping them to areas of differing brightness on a screen.

Brighter areas represent stronger echoes, often indicating dense tissues, while darker areas represent weaker echoes, often indicating fluid or soft tissues.

### 16 QAM digital communication
**16 QAM digital communication** or *16 Quadrature Amplitude modulation digital communication* is a type of digital communication where data is transmitted by varying both the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal.

This is done by using 2 waves: a sine-wave and cosine wave; the data is then grouped into 4-bit sequences which control the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal giving rise to 16 unique combinations, making it more efficient then transmission techniques like BPSK and QPSK.

## Things I accomplished:
- Gave a quick read to the research paper provided to get a general idea of the project
- Added my branch to the project repository and started the daily markdown blogs
