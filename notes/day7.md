## Keywords:
### Ratiometric Approach:
A ratiometric approach is a measurement technique that uses the ratio of two or more signals to improve accuracy and sensitivity, particularly in situations where traditional single-signal methods are unreliable due to interfering substances or varying conditions

### Advantages of the ratiometric approach:
- Improved Noise reduction
- Balanced signal path
- Support for Bipolar Excitation
- Cleaner differential voltage measurement
- Improved accuracy

### ADCs and DACs
ADCs or Analog to Digital converters are systems which convert analog signals to digital signals. Typically the digital output is a two's complement binary number that is proportional to the input, but there are other possibilities. 

DACs or Digital to Analog converters are systems which convert digital signals to digital signals. Due to the complexity and the need for precisely matched components, all but the most specialized DACs are implemented as integrated circuits (ICs).

### Vivado
Vivado is a software suite developed by AMD for designing, synthesizing, and implementing hardware designs targeting their FPGAs and adaptive SoCs. It's a comprehensive environment that encompasses various stages of the design flow, from initial design entry to final implementation and verification

## Things I accomplished:
- Went through the paper provided to us (on a ratiometric approach to measure temp. from thermistors)
- Rewatched the videos on flip-flops from the digital electronics playlist
